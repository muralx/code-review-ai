### Automated changes

A change authored by a bot (a dependency bump, a lockfile refresh, regenerated code, a
formatter or migration run) is reviewed for what the automation can get wrong, not line by
line. Recognise it by the author account, the title convention or a description that names
the tool; human commits on top of it return their hunks to normal review.

- Dependency bump: read the dependency's changelog or release notes between the old and the
  new version for breaking changes, deprecations and security advisories; confirm the lockfile
  moved with the manifest and resolves to one version; build and run the suite. File a finding
  only on those points: an unaddressed breaking change in the range is **Major**, a failing
  build **Critical**. Otherwise file nothing.
- Lockfile refresh or regenerated code: reproduce it (run the resolver or generator in a
  temporary copy) and diff against the change; a hunk the tool does not reproduce is a hand
  edit inside a generated file and the one finding worth filing.
- Do not review formatting-only or regenerated hunks line by line, and do not file idiom,
  naming or structure findings on generated code. No Nits.
- A major-version bump, or a version range that contains a security advisory the bump does
  not fix, is reviewed as a normal change: the automation does not know what it broke.
- Prose: one sentence stating that the change is automated and what was checked (the version
  range read, the commands run), then the verdict. An empty findings block is the expected
  outcome.
