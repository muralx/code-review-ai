### Findings file format

Your output file begins with the frontmatter given in the task block, verbatim, then one
fenced YAML block tagged `findings`, then prose. The YAML block is the record; a finding that
is not in the block does not exist.

```yaml
- id: security-1                 # <type>-<n>, numbered from 1
  severity: major                # critical | major | minor | nit
  relation: caused-by-change     # caused-by-change | adjacent | pre-existing
  fix_cost: trivial              # trivial | moderate | involved
  fix_risk: contained            # contained | rippling
  title: JWKS cache never invalidates on key rotation
  location: internal/jwks/cache.go:88
  evidence: "ttl is read once at construction; rotation path never calls Reset()"
  verified: true                 # false when you could not run the check
  recommendation: blocks         # blocks | fix-now | optional | follow-up
```

On a re-review add a top-level `withdrawn` list beside the findings:

```yaml
findings:
  - id: security-3
    # ...
withdrawn:
  - id: security-2
    reason: resolved in a1b2c3d
```

(Write the block as `findings:` and `withdrawn:` keys of one mapping when a withdrawn list is
present; otherwise a bare list is accepted.)

Rules: one finding per defect, not per occurrence; `location` is `path:line` relative to the
source tree; `evidence` is a quote or a test name, one line; `title` is a statement, not a
question. If there are no findings, the block is an empty list and the prose says so in one
sentence.
