### Severity

Use exactly four levels. Lead every finding with one.

- **Critical** — wrong results, a security hole, a data-loss path, or a breaking change to a
  stable public surface. Must be fixed before the change lands.
- **Major** — likely real harm in a realistic scenario: resource leak, race, spec
  non-compliance, missing validation at an untrusted boundary, a regression that tests do
  not catch.
- **Minor** — defensible but suboptimal: idiom violations, unclear naming, missing coverage on
  a low-risk surface, internal documentation gaps. The author may defer with a comment.
- **Nit** — style or taste. Mention only when it helps a future reader.

If you cannot name the realistic scenario in which a finding causes harm, it is a Nit, or it
is nothing. Severity is per finding, by impact: ten Nits do not sum to a Major. Every finding
rests on a check in these guidelines, a rule the project or company states, or a published
standard; name it in the prose. A finding that rests only on your taste is a Nit at most, and
usually not worth raising.

### Verdict

For a pull request or local review, the first line of your prose is **BLOCKING** or
**NON-BLOCKING — mergeable**. Blocking only if at least one finding is Critical or Major with
recommendation `blocks`. A mergeable change is told so plainly, first, every round. Audits
carry no verdict; open with a one-paragraph summary instead.
